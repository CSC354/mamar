#+title: Mamar

Mamar — مَمَرُّ is our basic method to have constant porting for all services. It's a very basic
tool:

1. Inside a ~/opt/mamar~ file (should be passed as an argument), have a 2 columns structure:
   #+begin_example
# You can write comments
service_1 8000
service_2 8002
service_3 8003
   #+end_example
   *You must do this with _spaces_ /not/ tabs.*
2. Call ~GetPort~ RPC with the services name and it will return the corresponding port

Mamar is listening at port 8000, we consider it a master port.

* To Implement
+ Log invalid requests (for tracing purpose).
